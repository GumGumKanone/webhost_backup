# License
No proper licensing chosen yet. So far: Mainly you can do with this whatever you want. This explicitly includes
- Using the script to backup your private or commercial site.
- Modifying the script and sharing the modified version. In this case the original author (me) must be named and a link to either this github repository or the blog entry included in the source (e.g. in the backup.php file).

Commercial redistribution is not allowed. If you want to make money using this, contact me first and we can talk about the details.

# Disclaimer
I take no responsibility in any way for damage done by using this script. Please act responsibly and make sure that your backups work the way you expect them to.
